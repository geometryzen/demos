# README.py
print "Geometry Zen Computational Models"

# It might be interesting to make the README more interactive by letting it be a Python program?
#
# FYI: The rendering of markdown (*.md) documents will look a bit wierd in Geometry Zen until we 
# recognize them as markdown and not Python programs.
