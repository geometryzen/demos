The Geometry Zen eight module is a thin wrapper around the powerful Three.JS JavaScript library used
for WebGL 3D graphics programming. 

(The Three.js library provides an easy-to-use, object-oriented API for WebGL and is widely used with an active community.)

The eight module extends the Three.JS library by providing a multivector as a generalization of THREE.Vector3. This facilitates Geometric Algebra calculations as 
opposed to simply Linear Algebra.

While Geometry Zen has a Python language binding, it should be possible to make effective use of the documentation at threejs.org/docs as documentation for the eight Python module.

The name 'eight' is a play on words derived from the 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 coordinates required for the Geometric Algebra generated by a 3D Linear Algebra. In Linear Algebra the units of computation are scalars and vectors, and the vector has three components. In the corresponding Geometric Algebra, the units of computation are blades and a general multivector is a sum of these blades in an 8D Linear Space.
