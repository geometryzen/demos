This folder contains examples of 2D programming using the 'sprite' module.

The 'sprite' module is a tweaked version of the 'turtle' programming model.

I don't recommend using 'sprite' it except for very new programmers learning Python.

Even then, it may be better to use the HTML5 Canvas API through the 'browser' module.
