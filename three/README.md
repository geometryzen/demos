The Geometry Zen eight module is a thin wrapper around the Three.JS JavaScript library.

The Three.js library provides an easy-to-use, object-oriented API for WebGL.

While Geometry Zen has a Python language binding, it should be possible to make effective use of the documentation at threejs.org/docs.

The name 'eight' is a play on words derived from the 2 * 2 * 2 = 8 coordinates required for the Geometric Algebra generated by a 3D Linear Algebra. In Linear Algebra the units of computation are scalars and vectors, and the vector has three components. In the corresponding Geometric Algebra, the units of computation are blades and a multivector is a sum of these blades in an 8D Linear Space.
