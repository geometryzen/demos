The Geometry Zen three module is a thin wrapper around the Three.JS JavaScript library.

The Three.js library provides an easy-to-use, object-oriented API for WebGL.

While Geometry Zen has a Python language binding, it should be possible to make effective use of the documentation at threejs.org/docs.
