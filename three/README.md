The Geometry Zen 'three' module is a thin wrapper around the powerful Three.JS JavaScript library used
for WebGL 3D graphics programming. 

(The Three.js library provides an easy-to-use, object-oriented API for WebGL and is widely used with an active community.)

While Geometry Zen three is a Python language binding for Three.JS, it should be possible to make effective use of the documentation
at threejs.org/docs as documentation for the three Python module.
